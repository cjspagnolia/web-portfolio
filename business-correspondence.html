            In this assignment we were asked to read through an annual report
            and write a memo assessing the report. I chose to base my report on
            Microsoft’s 2020 annual report and evaluated the first three
            sections.

            <b>Subject:</b> Short Report on Microsoft’s Annual Report
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            I am sharing what I have learned from the first few sections of
            Microsoft’s Annual Report of 2020 as well as my insights on how the
            company fared during the height of the pandemic and how they managed
            to help others prosper in a time of uncertainty. I will be
            discussing three sections from the report: shareholder's letter,
            financial analysis, and business. <br />
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            <em>Shareholder's Letter</em>
            <br />
            Microsoft’s annual report outlines how despite the global pandemic
            hurting most other industries, the technology sector was able to
            produce profit and growth. Most of the Shareholder Letter is focused
            on how they pushed through and showed resilience by highlighting
            portions of their business that have seen success. The information
            in the first section is laid out in a cohesive way that is to the
            point while still being full of information that shareholders would
            find important.
            <br />
            <br />
            There is only one thing that I think this section is missing. The
            letter places a large focus on Azure, their cloud computing
            platform, and not much time is spent on any other part of their
            operations. It would benefit the investors if there was more
            information as to what the company is doing besides Azure as they
            will have more background in their investment.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            <em>Financial Analysis</em>
            <br />
            The Financial Review section backs up their earlier claims that the
            technology sector was able to handle the pandemic well. 2020 was one
            of the most profitable years to date. There is a highlights section
            that is a nice touch for those who do not want to read the whole
            thing but still want a view into how the company’s finances were.
            The section as a whole is short and to the point.
            <br /><br />
            The section could be made easier to follow. There are a lot of
            tables and a single graph with little to no context as to why this
            year was financially different from other years. The graph’s key
            could be misread as “6/15” as June 15th instead of the intended June
            2015. This could be easily rectified by adding the first two numbers
            to the year.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            <em>Business</em>
            <br />
            The third portion of the report is dedicated to outlining their
            future business ambitions. A large part of their plans for the
            future are about their Azure cloud computing, as it is a major
            source of revenue for the company, and Artificial Intelligence. The
            section overall is a lot more detailed than the previous two
            sections with specific information as to what they plan to do in the
            near and distant future.
            <br /><br />
            The only thing in this section that I can recommend is increasing
            the contrast between subsections and differentiating between topics
            in the subsections. As it is right now the main way to figure out
            what topic you are reading is by looking at the top right corner
            where it says clearly what section you are in.
            <br /><br />
            In summary, Microsoft has been able to be more profitable than ever
            despite the pandemic ruining most other companies finances. The
            report itself is laid out in a legible and logical fashion with
            sparse use of tables and very limited graphs. Overall, if there were
            more graphs and tables to drive home points made, the readability
            would be higher.

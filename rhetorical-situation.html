            This assignment asked us to think of a presentation we had that day
            and describe the rhetorical situation. I used a presentation from
            class that day in which we had a guest speaker talking about the
            program she wanted us to develop for her. I assessed how and why she
            was giving the presentation as well as the purpose.

          <p class="bio">
            For my CISC275 class, we have to make a program for a client and
            that client just gave a presentation on what she expects us to make
            and her ideas so far. This presentation was given over zoom in the
            early evening so the dynamic of the presentation was relaxed but
            professional with her main interaction besides the PowerPoint being
            her asking if we had any questions. She was presenting to a class of
            mostly computer science majors so the terms and ideas she was
            presenting were field-specific but also had to be general enough for
            the non-CS majors to understand. The presentation’s main purpose was
            to inform us on how the client would like her program designed and
            what functionality it would have while also having some fun with the
            idea of her program.

            In this assignment we were tasked with reading and assessing the
            Surgeon General’s initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic and
            determining if their response was ethical. I used the IABC Code of
            Ethics and the reading to come to a conclusion.
          </div>
          <p class="bio">
            According to the IABC Code of Ethics and based on what we read in
            chapter 1.4, I do not believe the surgeon general communicated
            ethically since he was aware that masks were effective and still
            told the general public not to buy them and going as far as to say
            they aren't necessary. The first thing listed in the Code of Ethics
            is "I am honest" and the surgeon general was knowingly dishonest
            when stating they were not necessary for protecting the general
            public. He was aware that they could save lives but chose to instead
            lie to save the inventory of masks for healthcare workers. In
            chapter 1.4, one of the main ideas is that "the ethical communicator
            is trustworthy" meaning that in order to effectively and ethically
            communicate you need trust. Openly lying to your audience is
            generally considered bad for trust and reputation. Trust is
            something that is hard to obtain but very easy to lose. In theory,
            the plan was to try and save the supply for those who truly needed
            them. However lying to the public, at the beginning of a pandemic,
            might have been the cause of so many people not wearing masks and
            the skepticism around them later on in the pandemic. It can be
            argued that this saved some professional lives but at the cost of
            civilian lives and trust in the government in a very needing time.
            If instead, the message was that masks should be designated to
            health care professionals first then the general public, the public
            reception of it might have been better and more ethical.
